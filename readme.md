MansOS
===============
An operating system for small embedded systems, wireless sensor networks and IoT.

See the [wiki][] for a quick intro.

MansOS is an operating system for embedded systems with restricted resources, 
such as platforms based on msp430 and various Atmega controllers (e.g. for Arduino hardware).
The OS also includes support for radio transceivers, such as cc2420.

The OS built so it is easy to use and easy to port to other platforms.
