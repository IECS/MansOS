This is an alternative remote access provider.
The other options are to use the web interface and OMF.

The pros of remote access proxy:
* very simple, ASCII based communication over HTTP
* low server-side complexity - all code fits in just a few python files!

The pros of web interface:
* the only method at the moment with per-user access control levels
* a visual, easy-to-use user interface for beginners

The pros of OMF:
* unified method, can be used both for sensor node and WiFi router testing


All three mothods can be combined. For example, remotely connected nodes
can be made to appear in the web interface with help of remote access proxy.
On the other hand, more experienced users can write OMF experiemnts
than make use of the remote access client and server programs.
